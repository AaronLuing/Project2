# Project 2:MüvieChat

MüvieChat is my second project for General Assembly, and my first full-stack application.  I set out to use all the knowledge I've gained so far in order to build a basic movie commenting site from the ground up.

# Approach

When planning this project, I started with a handdrawn wireframe of how I wanted the site laid out.  Knowing how I wanted things placed on-screen early on would help me later once writing the code.  The visual also helped me determin what routes I would need, and what features would need to be added to achieve the functionality I wanted.
From there, it was just a process of setting up my file structure to match my needs, and lay out my RESTful routes

# Technologies and Techniques

This website was built using NodeJS as the foundation, with Express and EJS added in for functionality.  Mongoose was also implemented in order to add server functionality to the app and allow access to a database in MongoDB.  Finally, I used Axios in order to implement my API request/responses.

# Unsolved Problems

The biggest challenge came, surprisingly enough, from my MVC file structure. I enountered trouble properly linking my stylesheets from my public folder.  Though with help from my instructors I was able to fix the issue locally, I still am unable to access my stylesheets on my Heroku deployment.

# Conclusion
My website is deployed globally via heroku here:

I had mentioned to several classmates during creation of this project that it felt both easier, and harder, than my first Project.  With less function writing but a larger file structure, it presented new challenges in how to organize and keep track of a bigger project such as this.
